## SQL PROJECT IN TWO PARTS : 

I have carried out the SQL Project in two parts ( An outcome of Data Bootcamp by Alex - The Analyst ).

### PART I :

The first part of the Project has been carried out by extracting a file named "coronavirus-data-explorer.csv" ( Source ourworldindata.org/covid-deaths ).

From this file that is "coronavirus-data-explorer.csv" two different files have been created which are "CovidDeaths" and "CovidVaccinations".

This part of the project is mostly on data exploration from "coronavirus-data-explorer.csv" and the results being put in the two above files.

The entire task performed in the first part of the project has been put in a File named " COVID - PROJECT SQL.sql ".

It may please be noted that all the commands given in the file "COVID - PROJECT SQL.sql" has been executed on the two files CovidDeaths and CovidVaccinations.

### PART II :

The second part of the Project has been carried out by extracting a file named "Nashville Housing Data for Data Cleaning.xlsx " ( Source github.com/AlexTheAnalyst/PortfolioProjects ).

This part of the project is mostly on Data Cleaning.

The entire task performed in the project has been put in a File named " NashvilleHousing.sql ".

It may please be noted that all the commands given in the file "NashvilleHousing.sql" has been executed on the original file "Nashville Housing Data for Data Cleaning.xlsx " ( Source github.com/AlexTheAnalyst/PortfolioProjects )
